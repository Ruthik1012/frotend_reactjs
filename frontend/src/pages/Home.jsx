        <p class="card-text">.Prep your ingredients: Cut the chicken, chop the onion, garlic, ginger, and prepare your tomatoes. Heat the oil: In a large pan or pot, heat the vegetable oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for about 30 seconds. Sauté aromatics: Add the chopped onions to the pan. Sauté until they turn golden brown (about 5-7 minutes). Then, add the garlic and ginger, cooking for another minute until fragrant. Add the spices: Stir in the turmeric, coriander powder, garam masala, chili powder, and salt. Cook for 1-2 minutes to allow the spices to toast and become aromatic. Cook the chicken: Add the chicken pieces to the pan and cook for about 5-7 minutes until the chicken is lightly browned on all sides. Add tomatoes: Stir in the pureed or chopped tomatoes. Cook for another 5-6 minutes, allowing the tomato to break down and blend with the spices. Add liquid: Pour in the coconut milk (or tomato puree) and a splash of water to achieve your desired sauce consistency. Stir everything together and bring to a simmer. Simmer: Let the curry simmer on low heat for about 20-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the chicken to cook through completely. Garnish and serve: Check the seasoning and adjust with more salt or spices if needed. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve hot with rice, naan, or roti. Optional: For a richer flavor: Add a splash of cream towards the end of cooking. For extra heat: Add green chilies or extra chili powder.. </p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Biryani</h5>
        <p class="card-text">-Marinate the chicken: In a bowl, mix the chicken pieces with all the marinade ingredients (yogurt, ginger garlic paste, spices, lemon juice, and salt). Cover and let it marinate for at least 1 hour (ideally overnight for deeper flavor). 2. Cook the rice: In a large pot, bring the 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt. Add the soaked rice and cook for 8-10 minutes, until the rice is 70-80% cooked (it should still be firm). Drain the rice and set aside. 3. Prepare the chicken: In a large pan or pot, heat the ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown. Add the ginger, garlic, and green chilies (if using). Cook for another minute until fragrant. Add the marinated chicken along with all the marinade. Cook for about 10-12 minutes until the chicken is nearly cooked through and the oil starts separating from the gravy. Stir in the chopped tomatoes and cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken. 4. Layer the Biryani: In a large pot (or the same pan if it’s deep enough), layer the cooked chicken mixture at the bottom. Spread the partially cooked rice over the chicken layer. Drizzle the saffron milk over the rice (if using). Sprinkle some fried onions (optional) and a little rose or kewra water for added fragrance. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal with dough to trap the steam. 5. Cook the Biryani: Cook the biryani on low heat (use the “dum” method) for about 20-25 minutes. You can place a heavy pan under the biryani pot to prevent burning and allow even cooking. Alternatively, you can bake the biryani at 350°F (175°C) for about 20 minutes. 6. Garnish and Serve: Once the biryani is cooked, fluff the rice gently and mix the chicken and rice together. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and fried onions. Serve the biryani hot with raita, salad, or a boiled egg on the side. Enjoy your flavorful homemade chicken biryani!..</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Egg Recipe</h5>
        <p class="card-text"> Prep the eggs: Boil the eggs in water for about 10 minutes, peel them, and set them aside. Cook the onions: Heat oil or ghee in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown (about 5-7 minutes). Add the garlic, ginger, and spices: Stir in the garlic, ginger, and slit green chili (if using). Cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Add turmeric powder, chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and salt. Stir well to combine. Add tomatoes: Add the pureed or chopped tomatoes to the pan. Cook for about 5-6 minutes until the tomatoes break down and the oil starts separating from the masala. Make the gravy: Add about 1/2 cup of water to the pan, and stir to create a thick gravy. Let it simmer for 5-7 minutes. Add the eggs: Gently add the boiled eggs to the gravy. Stir them around so they get coated with the curry sauce. Let them simmer in the gravy for about 5 minutes to absorb the flavors. Finish the curry: Stir in the garam masala and cream (or coconut milk) if using. Cook for another 2-3 minutes. Taste and adjust the salt and spice level as needed. Garnish and serve: Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves. Serve your egg curry hot with rice, roti, or naan. Enjoy this flavorful and comforting egg curry!..</p>
